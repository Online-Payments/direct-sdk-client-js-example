# Online Payments Client SDK Examples

This repository contains all SDK examples for the Online Payments JavaScript Client SDK.
Refer to the README in each folder for more details about that specific example.

## Full vs. minimal

Full examples offer a fully working payment flow that mimics all the functionality that the hosted payment pages offer.
The minimal examples show you how to include the SDK with a module loader.
